# BrowserBro üòé
BrowserBro is a simple HTTP server and a collection of plugins that are useful for web scraping, testing and many other things.
With browserBro you can turn any website into an API.

At its core, BrowserBro is using [Rod](https://github.com/go-rod/rod), a high-level Go browser automation library.

## Getting started

First, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

To run the project you will need to install [Docker](https://docker.com).

#### Docker
```bash
docker-compose up --build -d
```
The command above will start two containers: the API server and the browser server.
The API server is this project, and the browser server (Rod) [is pre-built](https://github.com/go-rod/rod/pkgs/container/rod). 

#### Manual
Alternatively, you can build the project manually and run the browser server separately.
```bash
go build main.go
```

#### Environment variables
You can configure the server by setting the following environment variables:

`BROWSERBRO_SERVER_ADDRESS` - the address the API server will listen on (default: `:10001`)

`BROWSERBRO_FILE_STORE_BASE_PATH` - the directory where the files will be stored on the API server (default: `/tmp/browserBro_files`)

`BROWSERBRO_BROWSER_SERVICE_URL` - the address of the browser server (default: `ws://localhost:7317`)

`BROWSERBRO_BROWSER_SERVER_ID` - the ID of the browser server. Only necessary if are running multiple browser instances (default: `1`)

`BROWSERBRO_BROWSER_MONITOR_ENABLED` - enable/disable the browser monitor. Useful for debugging (default: `true`)

`BROWSERBRO_BROWSER_USER_DATA_DIR` - the directory where the browser data will be stored on the browser server (default: `/tmp/rod/user-data/browserBro_userData`)



## Plugins ‚öôÔ∏è
BrowserBro comes with a collection of plugins that can be used to perform various tasks.
The plugins are loaded dynamically, so you can easily extend the functionality of BrowserBro by adding your own plugins.

Plugins are available as HTTP endpoints and can be accessed by sending a POST request to the server.
You can supply the plugin with the necessary parameters in the request body.
```
POST /api/v1/plugins/{plugin-name}
```

#### Example
Look how simple it is to scrape google search results with BrowserBro üîç
```bash
curl -X POST -d '{"query":"latest Golang news"}' http://localhost:10001/api/v1/plugins/googlesearch
``` 
Response:
```json
{
  "googlesearch": {
    "all": [
      {
        "description": "A weekly newsletter about the Go programming language ...",
        "link": "https://golangweekly.com/",
        "title": "Golang Weekly"
      },
      ...
    ]
  }
}
```

### Available plugins

To get a list of all available plugins:
```
GET /api/v1/plugins
```

1. [Google search](pkg%2Fplugins%2Fgooglesearch%2FREADME.md)
2. [Screenshot](pkg%2Fplugins%2Fscreenshot%2FREADME.md)

## Files üìÅ
BrowserBro can also serve static files generated or downloaded by the plugins.
The files are available at the following URL:
```bash
GET /api/v1/files/{fileID}
```
Files can also be deleted by sending a DELETE request to the same URL.
```bash
DELETE /api/v1/files/{fileID}
```

#### Example
When you use the `screenshot` plugin, the plugin will save the screenshots as files and return the file IDs in the response.
```json
{
  "screenshot": {
    "files": [
      "Shu2vLZm.screenshot.png"
    ]
  }
}
```
You can then access the files by sending a GET request to the file URL.
```bash
curl http://localhost:10001/api/v1/files/Shu2vLZm.screenshot.png
```

## Health Check
To check if the server is running, you can send a GET request to the health check endpoint.
```
GET /api/v1/health
```
